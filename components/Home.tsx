          Hi, my name is Pravesh Kunwar, and I'm currently a student at the
          University of Michigan in Ann Arbor! I'm currently a CS Major, with
          plans of doing an Electrical Engineering Minor! I am eager to learn
          and explore new technologies, and I thrive in environments where
          innovation and collaboration are encouraged. I love the challenge of
          solving complex problems and enjoy working on projects that make a
          meaningful impact in any area that is involved.
